		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Hello, I'm <strong>Alexis Vielma</strong>. I'm a <s>straight-C</s> Computer Science student at the
			<a href="https://ku.edu" target="_blank" data-no-tooltip>University of Kansas</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I design and build accessible and inclusive experiences for the web. On my free time, I enjoy collecting and
			spinning vinyl records, learning languages, watching k-dramas, and playing <a

				target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now, I'm working at <a href="https://kjhk.org">KJHK 90.7 FM</a>, building apps, dashboards, and
			playing around with cool analog hardware. I'm also a Front End Engineer Intern at <a
				href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a
